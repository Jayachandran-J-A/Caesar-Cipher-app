# Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption App

## Overview
The **Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption App** is a desktop application designed to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher technique. The app provides a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to input text, choose an encryption/decryption shift value, and get the results instantly.

### Key Features:
- **Encrypts text** using the Caesar Cipher method.
- **Decrypts text** by reversing the Caesar Cipher process.
- Simple user interface for ease of use.

## Caesar Cipher Overview
The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption algorithm that shifts each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This app allows you to input any text and encrypt or decrypt it using a user-specified shift value.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for other ciphers.
- Enhance the graphical interface for a better user experience.
- Implement features like brute force attacks on the encrypted message.
