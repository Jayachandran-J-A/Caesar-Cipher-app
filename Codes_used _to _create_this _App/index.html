      <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
      <p>A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 
        1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on. The method is named after Roman leader Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.</p>

      <h2>Features of caesar cipher:</h2>
      <p>1.Substitution cipher: The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.</p>
      <p>2.Fixed key: The Caesar cipher uses a fixed key, which is the number of positions by which the letters are shifted. This key is known to both the sender and the receiver.</p> 
      <p>3.Symmetric encryption: The Caesar cipher is a symmetric encryption technique, meaning that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.</p>  
      <P>4.Limited keyspace: The Caesar cipher has a very limited keyspace of only 26 possible keys, as there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet.</P>
